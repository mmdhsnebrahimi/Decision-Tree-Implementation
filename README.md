# Machine Learning Project 02: Decision Tree Classification 🌳

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of my second Machine Learning university project. The primary objective of this project is to design, implement, and analyze a Decision Tree classifier. Decision Trees are powerful predictive models used for both classification and regression tasks, and this project dives deep into their core mechanics, including data splitting, impurity measurements, and tree pruning.

## Project Details
In this notebook (`ML_Project02_DT.ipynb`), the complete pipeline for a machine learning classification task is developed. The workflow starts with comprehensive data preprocessing, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for training. 

The core of the project focuses on building the Decision Tree model to accurately classify the data points based on their features. Furthermore, the model's performance is strictly evaluated using standard classification metrics to ensure its reliability and accuracy on unseen data.

## Key Features
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and structuring the raw data for optimal model training.
* **Model Implementation:** Training and tuning a Decision Tree classifier.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Calculating key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to assess model robustness.
* **Result Analysis:** Detailed explanation of the model's behavior and the impact of different hyperparameters.

## Technologies Used
* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **NumPy & Pandas** (Data manipulation and mathematical operations)
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Data visualization)
* **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning utilities and metrics)
